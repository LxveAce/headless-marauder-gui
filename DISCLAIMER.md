# Disclaimer & Acceptable Use

**Headless Marauder** is a security-research tool, provided for **authorized, lawful use only**.

## Authorized & lawful use only
Use this only on devices, networks, and systems you **own** or have **explicit permission** to test. Many things security tooling like this can do — deauthentication, evil portals, beacon/BLE spam, RF transmission, packet capture, wardriving, anti-forensic wiping, and the like — are **illegal when aimed at people, devices, or networks you don't own or aren't authorized to test**. Laws including the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the UK Computer Misuse Act, the FCC prohibition on willful interference (47 U.S.C. §333), and their equivalents worldwide may apply. **Know what's legal where you are before you start.**

## Provided "as is" — no warranty
This software is provided **"as is", without warranty of any kind**, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, reliability, or non-infringement.

## No liability — you assume all risk
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the author (**LxveAce**) is **not liable** for anything you do with this software, or for any damage, data loss, service interruption, legal consequence, or other harm arising from its use or misuse. If you use it, **you accept that risk and take full responsibility** for your actions.

## Your responsibility
You are **solely responsible** for ensuring your use complies with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and with the terms of any network or system you interact with. Nothing here grants you permission to do anything you would not otherwise be allowed to do.

## Not legal advice
This is a good-faith, plain-language notice — **not legal advice**. If you need certainty about what is lawful for you, consult a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction.

## Firmware

This app is just a serial controller — it sends text commands to an ESP32 running [Marauder firmware](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder). The firmware is a separate project (GPL, by justcallmekoko). The built-in flasher downloads binaries from the official Marauder GitHub releases. It doesn't verify firmware signatures, so check what you're flashing.

## Privacy

The app doesn't phone home or collect any data. Logs, captures, JSON snapshots — everything stays on your machine in a folder you pick. The web UI runs on localhost by default.

## Dependencies

This project uses open-source libraries (PyQt5, Flask, pyserial, esptool, Textual, etc.). I'm not responsible for bugs or vulnerabilities in upstream packages. See `requirements.txt` for the full list.
